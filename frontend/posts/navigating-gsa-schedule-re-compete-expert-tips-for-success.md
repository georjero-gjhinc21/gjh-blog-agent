## II. Preparing Your Team for the Re-compete Process: Key Roles and Responsibilities

To prepare your team for the GSA Schedule re-compete process, it's essential to identify key roles and responsibilities. This will ensure that everyone is aware of their tasks and can work collaboratively towards a successful outcome.

### 1. Program Manager:

The Program Manager (PM) is typically responsible for overseeing the overall re-compete process. Their primary focus should be on ensuring compliance with GSA's requirements, managing deadlines, and maintaining communication among team members.

**Actionable Tip:** The PM should develop a project plan outlining specific tasks, timelines, and milestones for the re-compete effort. This will help track progress and identify potential issues early on.

### 2. Contracting Officer Representative (COR):

The COR is responsible for ensuring that your company's proposal meets GSA's requirements. They must review and analyze your submission to verify compliance with all applicable regulations and standards.

**Example:** If the contract requires a specific security clearance, the COR will ensure that you have obtained or can obtain the necessary clearance before submitting the proposal.

### 3. Technical Lead:

The Technical Lead is responsible for preparing the technical portions of the proposal, including any required certifications or documentation. They must be knowledgeable about the product or service being offered and ensure that all technical requirements are met.

**Actionable Tip:** The Technical Lead should work closely with other team members to gather necessary information and materials for the proposal. This may include creating a detailed plan outlining how your company will meet each of GSA's technical requirements.

By clearly defining these roles and responsibilities, you'll be better equipped to navigate the re-compete process and increase your chances of success. Remember to communicate regularly with your team and establish clear expectations to ensure everyone is working towards the same goal.

## III. Reviewing and Updating Existing Contracts: What to Expect and How to Prepare

As GSA Schedule contracts approach their 10-year mark, contractors can expect a flurry of re-compete windows. This means it's essential to review and update existing contracts to ensure competitiveness and compliance. To prepare your team, follow these steps:

**Review Contract Requirements**: Familiarize yourself with the solicitation requirements for each contract. For example, if you're planning to re-compete a 561 (Professional Services) schedule, review the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and ensure your company's capabilities align.

**Assess Past Performance**: Review past performance evaluations from previous contracts, including any awards or deficiencies. Identify areas where your team excelled and those that need improvement. Use this information to refine your proposal strategies and strengthen your bid.

**Update Your Business Systems**: GSA Schedule re-competes require up-to-date business systems, including financial management and accounting procedures. Ensure your company's systems are compliant with federal regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS).

**Enhance Your Proposal**: Review and update your proposal template to reflect changes in the market or industry. Highlight any new services or solutions you've developed since the initial contract award.

**Train Your Team**: Ensure all team members involved in the re-compete process are aware of their roles, responsibilities, and timelines. Provide training on updated business systems, proposal content, and submission deadlines.

By following these steps, your team will be well-prepared to tackle the GSA Schedule re-compete window. Remember, early planning is crucial to success in this highly competitive environment.

## IV. Market Research and Analysis: Identifying New Opportunities and Targeted Efforts

As you prepare to re-compete your GSA Schedule contract, it's essential to conduct thorough market research and analysis to identify new opportunities and targeted efforts. This involves analyzing industry trends, competitor activity, and emerging requirements from federal agencies.

Begin by reviewing the GSA's recently updated Strategic Sourcing Initiatives (SSIs) and Multiple Award Task Order Contracting (MATOC) initiatives, which prioritize strategic sourcing and increased competition among contractors. Analyze the SSIs' impact on your contract's scope and opportunities for growth.

Identify emerging trends in federal spending, such as cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, or cloud computing. Research GSA's upcoming solicitations and contracts that align with these areas, as well as those specific to your NAICS code. Utilize tools like the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) to track contract awards and identify potential partners or competitors.

Conduct competitor analysis by researching other contractors on your schedule, including their past performance ratings, market share, and recent contract wins or losses. Evaluate their strengths, weaknesses, and areas of specialization. Consider partnering with complementary businesses to expand your offerings or diversify into new markets.

Review GSA's Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) feedback and evaluate areas for improvement in your proposal submission process. Address any concerns through targeted efforts to enhance your company's overall performance and responsiveness to customer needs. By conducting thorough market research and analysis, you'll be better equipped to re-compete successfully and identify new opportunities for growth within the GSA Schedule program.

## V. Marketing and Sales Strategies: Showcasing Your Company's Value Proposition

As you prepare to re-compete for a GSA Schedule contract, it's essential to refine your marketing and sales strategies to effectively showcase your company's value proposition. This involves highlighting how your products or services meet specific agency needs and differentiate your organization from competitors.

Develop a clear understanding of the agency's pain points and requirements by reviewing solicitation documents, conducting market research, and engaging with potential customers. Identify key differentiators, such as unique features, certifications, or capabilities, that set your company apart in the marketplace.

Create targeted marketing materials, including case studies, brochures, and web content, that demonstrate how your solutions address specific agency needs. For example, if you offer cybersecurity services, develop a case study showcasing successful implementation of a similar solution for another government agency.

Leverage social media platforms to share relevant content, industry insights, and thought leadership pieces that establish your company as a trusted authority in the field. Utilize LinkedIn groups, Twitter chats, and other online forums where government agencies and contractors interact.

Collaborate with sales teams to develop sales scripts and talking points that emphasize the value proposition of your products or services. Ensure that all interactions with potential customers are guided by a clear understanding of their needs and priorities.

By refining your marketing and sales strategies, you'll be better equipped to effectively showcase your company's value proposition and increase your chances of success in the re-compete process.

## VI. Building Relationships with Federal Agencies: Networking and Partnership Development

As a GSA Schedule holder, you're likely aware that every 5-10 years, contracts come up for re-compete. This is an opportune time to review and refine your business strategies, including building relationships with federal agencies. Developing strong connections with potential customers can significantly impact your chances of winning new or continued contracts.

To start, familiarize yourself with the key decision-makers within target agencies. Attend industry events, conferences, and trade shows where you can network with procurement officials and learn about their specific needs and challenges. You can also leverage social media platforms to establish a professional online presence and connect with federal agency personnel.

Develop strategic partnerships by offering solutions that complement those of other contractors or vendors. This not only expands your offerings but also enhances the value proposition for agencies, making it more likely they'll choose you over competitors. For example, if you specialize in IT services, consider partnering with a cybersecurity firm to offer a comprehensive suite of solutions.

Regular communication is crucial when building relationships with federal agencies. Establish a proactive outreach plan that includes regular meetings, emails, and phone calls. This will not only keep you top-of-mind but also demonstrate your commitment to understanding their needs and providing tailored solutions.

To further solidify these connections, consider offering complimentary services or resources, such as webinars, whitepapers, or case studies. These can help establish thought leadership and showcase your expertise in meeting federal agency requirements. By proactively building relationships with key decision-makers and agencies, you'll position yourself for success when the re-compete window opens.

## VII. Navigating the Re-compete Proposal Process: Tips for Success and Common Pitfalls to Avoid

When participating in a GSA Schedule re-compete, it's essential to have a clear understanding of the proposal process and its complexities. One of the most critical aspects is assembling an effective team that can navigate the intricacies of the re-compete.

**Establish Clear Roles and Responsibilities**

To ensure success, define specific roles for each team member, including:

* A program manager responsible for overseeing the overall strategy and timeline
* Subject matter experts (SMEs) who will provide technical input on key areas such as IT or construction services
* A writer or communications specialist tasked with crafting compelling proposal content

Clearly outline each team member's responsibilities to avoid confusion and ensure a smooth workflow.

**Develop a Comprehensive Proposal Plan**

Create a detailed plan outlining the proposal process, including:

* Scheduling milestones and deadlines for each section of the proposal
* Assigning tasks to specific team members based on their expertise
* Establishing a review and approval process to ensure consistency across sections

For example, if your company offers IT services, your proposal plan might include dedicated time blocks for SMEs to provide technical input on areas such as cybersecurity or software development.

**Avoid Common Pitfalls**

Some common mistakes government contractors make during the re-compete proposal process include:

* Underestimating the complexity of the proposal and timeline
* Failing to engage subject matter experts early in the process
* Ignoring the importance of quality assurance and review processes

By establishing a clear team structure, developing a comprehensive proposal plan, and avoiding common pitfalls, government contractors can position themselves for success in the GSA Schedule re-compete.
