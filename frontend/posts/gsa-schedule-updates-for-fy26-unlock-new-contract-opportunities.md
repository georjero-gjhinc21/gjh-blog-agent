"Get ready to adapt: FY26 is just around the corner, and with it, new requirements for GSA schedules. As a contractor navigating the complexities of federal procurement, staying up-to-date on schedule updates is crucial to avoiding costly mistakes and ensuring compliance. For those holding or seeking a General Services Administration (GSA) schedule contract, this fiscal year brings significant changes that warrant attention.

Whether you're a seasoned veteran of government contracting or just entering the market, understanding these updates will be essential for success in FY26. From revised pricing structures to updated performance metrics, we'll break down the key takeaways and requirements contractors need to know. In this post, we'll provide a comprehensive overview of GSA schedule changes for FY26, equipping you with the knowledge necessary to adapt and thrive in an ever-evolving procurement landscape."

### A. Brief overview of GSA schedules and their importance for government contractors

GSA Schedules are a vital component of the federal procurement process, providing a streamlined way for government agencies to purchase goods and services from pre-approved vendors. As a contractor seeking to do business with the government, it's essential to understand the basics of GSA Schedules and their significance.

The General Services Administration (GSA) manages a portfolio of schedules that cover various categories of products and services, including IT, professional services, construction, and more. These schedules enable agencies to quickly procure needed goods and services from approved vendors, while also providing contractors with a predictable revenue stream.

To be awarded a GSA Schedule, contractors must meet specific requirements, such as demonstrating technical capabilities, experience, and past performance. Once awarded, contractors can list their products or services on the corresponding schedule, enabling government agencies to easily find and purchase from them.

For example, a software company might hold a GSA IT Schedule 70 contract, which allows federal agencies to purchase software solutions from approved vendors like themselves. In FY26, contractors should be prepared for potential updates to GSA Schedules, including changes to pricing, offerings, or requirements.

To stay ahead of the curve, contractors should:

* Review their existing contracts and ensure they meet current requirements
* Familiarize themselves with proposed schedule updates and any new opportunities
* Adjust their business strategies accordingly to capitalize on emerging trends and priorities in government contracting.

### B. Explanation of why FY26 updates are crucial for contractors to know

Understanding the GSA Schedule updates for Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) is crucial for contractors to remain competitive and compliant. The annual updates bring changes to the Multiple Award Schedules (MAS), which account for nearly 50% of all federal contract spending. Contractors who are not aware of these changes risk losing business opportunities or even being removed from the schedules.

One significant change in FY26 is the expansion of the Professional Services Schedule (PSS) 70 and 837 to include additional services, such as cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. Contractors who offer these services but have not yet updated their schedule should do so promptly, as this will enable them to compete for new business opportunities.

Another important update is the introduction of a new pricing structure for the Information Technology (IT) Schedule 70. This change affects contractors who provide IT products and services, requiring them to adapt their pricing strategies accordingly. For instance, if a contractor's product or service is listed as "unpriced" under the old system, they will need to establish a price under the new structure.

Contractors should also be aware of changes to the GSA's Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) requirements. This update affects contractors who have been awarded contracts in FY26 and require them to submit updated past performance data. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in contract terminations or other penalties.

By staying informed about the FY26 updates, contractors can position themselves for success in the government contracting market.

## II. Changes to Contract Requirements

The GSA Schedule program continues to evolve with updates aimed at enhancing customer experience and increasing transparency. As a contractor, it's essential to stay informed about these changes to ensure compliance and maximize opportunities.

One notable update is the implementation of "Commercial Item Determination" (CID) for all new schedule contracts awarded after FY25. This change requires contractors to provide detailed documentation supporting their commercial item determinations. Contractors will need to:

* Complete a revised Commercial Item Determination Checklist (CIC-3)
* Provide a detailed explanation of their commercial item determination, including relevant market research and industry standards
* Maintain records of all CID-related documentation for three years

Contractors who have existing contracts with CIDs will not be affected by this change. However, it's essential to review current CID documentation to ensure compliance with the new requirements.

Another update is the introduction of a new reporting requirement: quarterly reports on schedule sales and usage. These reports aim to improve data collection and analysis for GSA Schedule program performance. Contractors will need to submit these reports through the GSA's online portal, and failure to comply may result in contract suspension or termination.

Lastly, contractors should be aware that the GSA is exploring new technologies to enhance customer experience, including AI-powered tools for product research and procurement. While no specific implementation timeline has been announced, contractors can expect increased focus on digital transformation and innovation in the coming years.

### A. Updates to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and its impact on GSA schedules

The FY26 updates to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) bring significant changes that impact GSA schedules. Contractors must be aware of these modifications to ensure compliance and effectively market their products and services.

One key update is the expansion of the "Buy American" provision, which now requires federal agencies to consider domestic preferences for commercial items. This change affects contractors who offer commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) items on GSA schedules. Contractors must be prepared to provide documentation demonstrating that their COTS items meet the Buy American Act requirements.

Additionally, the FAR has introduced new guidelines for contract bundling and consolidation. These changes aim to reduce barriers to entry for small businesses and non-traditional contractors. However, they also introduce complexities for established contractors who may need to adjust their marketing strategies to comply with these new regulations.

Contractors should note that the updates also include revised requirements for pricing and contracting methods. Specifically, federal agencies are now required to use a price-based evaluation method when selecting contract awards. This change means that contractors must ensure their pricing is accurate and compliant with FAR requirements.

To prepare for FY26 GSA schedule updates, contractors should:

* Review FAR revisions carefully
* Update internal policies and procedures as needed
* Ensure compliance with new Buy American Act requirements
* Revise marketing strategies to reflect changes in contract bundling and consolidation

By understanding these updates and taking proactive steps, government contractors can effectively navigate the changing regulatory landscape and capitalize on opportunities for growth.

### B. New contract requirements for small businesses, women-owned small businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses

For FY26, GSA is introducing new contract requirements that aim to support small business growth and diversity. These changes are designed to promote equitable opportunities and encourage participation from underrepresented groups.

**Small Business Requirements**

Contractors seeking to maintain or acquire a Schedule contract will need to demonstrate increased small business involvement in their operations. This includes:

* A minimum of 50% small business subcontracting plans for contracts valued over $10 million
* Small businesses must be actively involved in the performance of work, not just serving as vendors
* Contractors must provide evidence of small business participation in their annual reviews

For example, if a contractor has three employees with at least 20% ownership, they may be considered a small business and can use the "small business" designation on their contract. However, if this small business is merely providing supplies or services as a subcontractor without involvement in performance work, it would not meet the requirements.

**Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Requirements**

To maintain or acquire a Schedule contract, contractors must demonstrate increased WOSB participation. This includes:

* A minimum of 5% WOSB subcontracting plans for contracts valued over $10 million
* Contractors must provide evidence of WOSB involvement in their annual reviews

For instance, if a contractor has an existing partnership with a certified WOSB, they can use this as leverage to meet the new requirements. However, contractors who fail to demonstrate satisfactory progress toward meeting these goals may face contract modifications or even contract termination.

**Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Requirements**

To maintain or acquire a Schedule contract, contractors must also demonstrate increased SDVOSB participation. This includes:

* A minimum of 5% SDVOSB subcontracting plans for contracts valued over $10 million
* Contractors must provide evidence of SDVOSB involvement in their annual reviews

Note that these requirements apply to all new and existing Schedule contracts, so contractors should review their current contracts and adjust their strategies accordingly.

## III. Category Management and Schedules Simplification

**Category Management and Schedules Simplification: Key Updates for Contractors**

As part of its ongoing efforts to modernize procurement processes, the General Services Administration (GSA) will implement significant changes to Category Management and Schedule simplification as part of FY26 updates. These updates aim to streamline acquisition, reduce complexity, and improve efficiency for both government agencies and contractors.

**Category Management Updates:**

*   **Increased focus on commercial best practices**: The GSA will prioritize incorporating private sector standards into its procurement processes.
*   **Enhanced category leads**: Category leads will have greater authority to make decisions and implement changes within their respective categories, enabling faster response times and more effective solutions.
*   **Streamlined contracting**: Category Management will be integrated with existing scheduling tools to reduce duplication of effort and enhance the overall contracting experience.

**Schedule Simplification:**

*   **Simplified schedule maintenance**: Contractors can expect reduced administrative burdens through simplified schedule maintenance processes.
*   **Increased online transparency**: The GSA will provide real-time access to contract information, enabling contractors to track their schedules more easily.
*   **Enhanced market research tools**: Contractors will have improved access to market research and data analytics, facilitating informed business decisions.

**Practical Action Steps for Contractors:**

1.  **Review and update your schedule offerings**: Ensure alignment with the updated Category Management structure and simplify your schedule maintenance processes.
2.  **Stay informed about GSA updates**: Register for GSA newsletters and attend industry events to stay up-to-date on policy changes and best practices.
3.  **Develop a strategic market research plan**: Leverage enhanced market research tools to refine your business strategy and improve competitiveness.

By understanding these Category Management and Schedule simplification updates, contractors can position themselves for success in the changing government contracting landscape.

### A. Overview of category management principles and their application to GSA schedules

Category Management Principles: A Guide for Government Contractors

The General Services Administration (GSA) has been actively promoting category management principles to streamline the procurement process and enhance efficiency. As a GSA Schedule contractor, it's essential to understand these principles and how they apply to your contract.

At its core, category management is about grouping similar products or services into categories to simplify the buying process. This approach allows government agencies to leverage collective purchasing power, reduce costs, and improve supply chain resilience. For GSA Schedule contractors, this means being prepared to participate in category-wide initiatives that can impact pricing, terms, and conditions.

To stay ahead of the curve, contractors should familiarize themselves with the following key aspects:

1. **Category definitions**: Understand which categories your products or services fall under and how they align with government needs.
2. **Market research**: Stay informed about industry trends, market demand, and competitor activity to ensure your offerings remain relevant and competitive.
3. **Contract modifications**: Be prepared for potential contract changes that may arise from category management initiatives.
4. **Pricing strategy**: Review pricing structures and adjust as needed to maintain competitiveness within your designated categories.

To illustrate the practical application of these principles, consider a scenario where a GSA Schedule contractor offers IT services across multiple categories (e.g., cloud computing, cybersecurity). As category management initiatives unfold, the contractor may need to adapt their pricing, service offerings, or contract terms to remain compliant and competitive. By staying informed about category management principles and their application to GSA schedules, contractors can proactively mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities that arise from these changes.

### B. How the schedules simplification initiative will affect contractors and federal agencies

The GSA Schedule Simplification Initiative is expected to have a significant impact on both federal agencies and contractors. This initiative aims to reduce complexity, increase transparency, and improve efficiency throughout the procurement process.

One key aspect of the schedule simplification initiative is the introduction of a new ordering system, known as the "BuyPoint" portal. This online platform will enable federal agencies to more easily find and purchase GSA schedules products and services. Contractors can expect increased visibility for their offerings, with BuyPoint featuring a robust search function and streamlined ordering process.

For contractors, this means that they must ensure their schedules are up-to-date and accurately reflect their capabilities and offerings. This includes:

* Reviewing and updating contract documents to ensure compliance with new requirements
* Conducting thorough analysis of product and service categorization to optimize visibility in the BuyPoint portal
* Ensuring all pricing and terms are accurate and compliant with GSA regulations

To maximize their chances of success, contractors should also be prepared to adapt to changes in federal agency buying behavior. The schedule simplification initiative is expected to drive increased use of online ordering and automated procurement tools.

In preparation for the rollout of BuyPoint, contractors should:

* Familiarize themselves with the new system's features and functionality
* Develop a plan to leverage the improved visibility and streamlined ordering process to grow their business
* Engage with GSA representatives to address any questions or concerns they may have

## IV. Pricing and Ordering Changes

**Changes to Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Price Lists**

For FY26, GSA will be implementing changes to the pricing and ordering processes for FSS contracts. Contractors should review their price lists to ensure compliance with these updates.

* **Price List Updates**: Contractors must update their price lists on the GSAXcess system by October 1, 2023, or risk being removed from the schedule. This includes updating prices for each commercial item description (CID) and product/service code.
* **GSA's Pricing Requirements**: GSA requires that contractors use a standard pricing format when submitting updates to their price lists. This format includes specific fields for unit prices, discounts, and payment terms. Contractors must ensure their price list meets these requirements to avoid rejection.
* **Price Discounts and Volume Discounts**: Effective October 1, 2023, GSA will begin enforcing price discount and volume discount policies more strictly. Contractors offering discounts on FSS contracts must clearly indicate the discount percentage and any associated conditions.

**Changes to Ordering Procedures**

GSA is also implementing changes to ordering procedures for FSS contracts:

* **E-Buy**: As of October 1, 2023, all orders placed through E-Buy will be processed electronically. Contractors should ensure their systems can process electronic orders efficiently.
* **Order Cancellation and Change Notification**: Contractors must provide written notice to the government within three days in case of order cancellations or changes.

Contractors should review these updates carefully and take necessary actions to avoid any potential issues with their FSS contracts.

### A. Updates to price negotiation procedures for GSA schedule contracts

Contractors holding General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule contracts should be aware of updates to price negotiation procedures effective FY26. These changes aim to promote transparency, fairness, and competitiveness in the contracting process.

The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) has been revised to require more detailed documentation of price negotiations between contractors and Contracting Officers (COs). Contractors must now provide a clear breakdown of prices, including all costs associated with the contract, such as labor rates, materials, and overhead. This increased transparency will enable COs to make informed decisions about contract awards.

To comply with these updates, contractors should:

* Review their price negotiation procedures to ensure they are providing detailed documentation
* Develop a clear pricing strategy that accounts for all relevant costs
* Be prepared to provide detailed explanations of any price adjustments or deviations from the initial proposal

For example, if a contractor is proposing a labor rate increase due to changes in market conditions, they should be able to provide documentation supporting this adjustment, such as industry surveys or benchmarking data.

Contractors should also familiarize themselves with the revised FAR provisions governing price negotiations, including:

* FAR 52.215-1, Price Reduction for Defective Pricing
* FAR 52.214-26, Estimated Total Price Range

By understanding these updates and taking proactive steps to comply, contractors can position themselves for success in the FY26 contracting cycle.

### B. New ordering processes and requirements for federal agencies

For FY26, the General Services Administration (GSA) has implemented new ordering processes and requirements for federal agencies. Contractors should be aware of these changes to ensure a seamless experience.

One significant update is the expansion of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.222-62. This clause now requires contractors to provide a detailed breakdown of their pricing, including direct costs, indirect costs, and any applicable taxes. Contractors must also include this information in their contract proposals.

Federal agencies will begin using the new Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) for reporting subcontractor data. Contractors should familiarize themselves with eSRS requirements, which include submitting subcontractor reports within 14 days of award or commencement of performance.

In addition, GSA has updated its rules regarding contract protests. Agencies are now required to provide a written explanation for the basis of any protest resolution, including the rationale behind their decision. Contractors should be prepared to review these explanations and adjust their strategies accordingly.

Contractors should also note that federal agencies will begin using a new system for tracking and managing small business contracts. This system, known as the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Procurement Center Representative (PCR), aims to increase transparency and oversight of small business contracting.

To stay ahead, contractors should review their current contracts and ensure compliance with these updated requirements. They should also familiarize themselves with GSA's training resources and guidance on implementing these new processes. By doing so, contractors can position themselves for success in the FY26 marketplace and maintain a strong reputation with federal agencies.

## V. Small Business and Veteran-Owned Business Opportunities

As government contracting continues to evolve, small business and veteran-owned businesses are poised to reap significant benefits from the updated GSA Schedule programs. For fiscal year 26 (FY26), the General Services Administration (GSA) has introduced several enhancements aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion.

**Increased Preference for Small Businesses**

In FY26, the GSA will implement a more robust preference for small businesses when awarding contracts under the Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program. Contractors can expect to see an increased emphasis on meeting or exceeding small business participation goals, which could lead to a higher likelihood of winning awards.

To capitalize on this opportunity, contractors should:

* Ensure their company is registered in the System for Award Management (SAM)
* Update their GSA eLibrary profile to highlight their small business status
* Review and revise their Small Business Administration (SBA) certification documents as needed

**Veteran-Owned Businesses: A Growing Priority**

The FY26 updates also place a greater emphasis on veteran-owned businesses, with the goal of increasing opportunities for these firms. Contractors can take advantage of this trend by:

* Exploring GSA's Veterans First Program, which prioritizes veteran-owned businesses in contract awards
* Reviewing and revising their business certification documents to ensure they meet the requirements for veteran-owned status
* Networking with other veteran-owned businesses and government agencies to stay informed about upcoming opportunities

By staying up-to-date on these developments and taking proactive steps, small business and veteran-owned contractors can position themselves for success in FY26.

### A. Increased opportunities for small businesses and veteran-owned businesses under FY26 updates

Under the updated Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) changes effective October 1, 2024, as part of FY26, there are significant opportunities for small businesses and veteran-owned businesses to increase their participation in government contracting. The updates aim to level the playing field by simplifying the process and reducing barriers to entry.

One key change is the expansion of the Small Business Enterprise (SBE) designation, which will now include all contractors with $10 million or less in annual revenues. This means that more small businesses will be eligible for set-asides and sole-source contracts. Additionally, the FY26 updates relax some requirements for veteran-owned businesses to qualify as Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) or Veterans Business Outreach Centers (VBOCs).

Contractors can take advantage of these changes by:

* Reviewing their company's eligibility for SBE designation and applying if applicable
* Reaching out to the relevant government agencies to inquire about available set-asides and sole-source contracts
* Developing business strategies tailored to meet the needs of small businesses and veteran-owned businesses

For example, contractors may want to consider partnering with small businesses or veteran-owned businesses to increase their chances of winning contracts. They can also leverage online resources such as the Small Business Administration's (SBA) website and the GSA's eLibrary to stay informed about upcoming opportunities.

By understanding these updates and adapting their business strategies accordingly, contractors can tap into new revenue streams and contribute to the government's efforts to support small businesses and veteran-owned businesses.

### B. Tips for contractors seeking to take advantage of these new opportunities

To capitalize on the updated GSA Schedule opportunities for FY26, contractors must be proactive and well-prepared. Here are some key tips to consider:

1. **Review and Update Your Solicitation Response**: Ensure that your company's solicitation response is current and compliant with the latest requirements. Review all sections, including pricing, labor categories, and technical capabilities. Consider revising your proposal to highlight new services or technologies that align with GSA's updated priorities.

2. **Conduct a Comprehensive Market Research Analysis**: Understand the evolving needs of federal agencies and identify opportunities for growth within your existing contract. Analyze competitors' strategies and adjust yours accordingly. Utilize market research tools, such as the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS), to stay informed about new requirements and trends.

3. **Develop a Winning Proposal Strategy**: Develop a winning proposal strategy that highlights your company's strengths, value proposition, and relevant experience. Emphasize how your services align with GSA's priorities and provide specific examples of successful projects completed for federal agencies.

4. **Enhance Your Past Performance Record**: Ensure that your past performance record accurately reflects your company's capabilities and achievements. Update your contracts, certifications, and awards to demonstrate a strong track record of delivering quality products and services to government clients.

5. **Stay Informed About GSA Schedule Updates**: Regularly monitor GSA's website and social media channels for updates on schedule changes, new solicitations, and requirements. This will enable you to stay ahead of the competition and capitalize on emerging opportunities.

## VI. Preparing for FY26 Updates: What Contractors Need to Do Now

As the new fiscal year approaches, contractors with a GSA Schedule contract should prepare for updates and changes that will impact their operations. To ensure a seamless transition into FY26, it's essential to take proactive steps now.

First, review your contract to identify any amendments or modifications that may be required due to changes in scope, pricing, or other factors. Check the GSA's website for any announcements or guidance related to FY26 updates and plan accordingly.

Contractors should also familiarize themselves with the updated solicitation package, which will include new requirements, clauses, and terms. Review the updated Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Agency Supplements to ensure compliance with government regulations.

Next, update your contract's pricing, including any changes to the schedule of prices or rates. This may involve revising your price list, updating your pricing model, or adjusting your discount structure. Be sure to submit your revised pricing to GSA in a timely manner to avoid any delays.

Another crucial step is to review and update your contract's terms and conditions, including clauses related to warranties, liability, and intellectual property. This may involve revising your Master Service Agreement (MSA) or other governing documents.

To ensure compliance with government regulations, contractors should also conduct an internal audit of their operations, focusing on areas such as:

* Pricing and payment procedures
* Contract administration and management
* Compliance with FAR and agency supplements
* Reporting and record-keeping requirements

By taking these proactive steps now, contractors can minimize disruptions and ensure a smooth transition into FY26. It's essential to work closely with your GSA contract manager and other stakeholders to address any questions or concerns that may arise during the update process.

### A. Checklist of steps contractors should take to prepare for the FY26 updates

To ensure a smooth transition into the new fiscal year, contractors should take the following steps to prepare for the FY26 GSA Schedule updates:

1. **Review and Update Proposal Content**: Review all proposal content, including technical proposals, past performance narratives, and small business participation plans. Update any outdated information or references to reflect changes in capabilities, services offered, or company structure.

Example: If a contractor has expanded its service offerings since the last update, they should highlight these new capabilities in their proposal to ensure alignment with GSA's requirements.

2. **Verify Pricing and Product Data**: Review pricing and product data for accuracy and consistency across all schedules and contracts. Ensure that prices are up-to-date and reflect any changes in costs or services provided.

Example: A contractor may need to update its price list or contract terms to reflect a change in labor rates or material costs.

3. **Update Online Presence and Marketing Materials**: Contractors should ensure their online presence, including websites and social media profiles, accurately reflects their GSA Schedule offerings and capabilities.

Example: If a contractor has new certifications (e.g., CMMI Level 3) or specializations (e.g., IT Service Management), they should prominently feature these on their website to attract more business.

4. **Prepare for Mandatory Reporting Requirements**: Contractors will need to prepare for mandatory reporting requirements, such as the submission of financial reports and other regulatory documents. Ensure all necessary documentation is complete and accurate before the deadline.

Example: A contractor may need to update its financial statements or provide additional information on subcontractor performance.

By taking these steps, contractors can ensure a smooth transition into FY26 and maximize their chances of success in the updated GSA Schedule program.

### B. Timeline for implementing changes and meeting updated requirements

The General Services Administration (GSA) has announced key updates to its GSA Schedule program for Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26). Contractors should be aware of the timeline for implementing changes and meeting updated requirements to avoid potential delays or penalties.

**Implementation Timeline:**

* **January-March FY26:** GSA will begin sending notifications to contractors regarding new requirements and schedule updates. Review these notifications carefully, as they will outline specific actions required.
* **April-June FY26:** Contractors must submit revised proposals and pricing agreements to reflect updated requirements. This includes revising their:
	+ Price lists: Update prices according to the new Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) price list requirements.
	+ Service descriptions: Revise descriptions of services offered under the GSA Schedule to ensure alignment with updated requirements.
* **July-September FY26:** GSA will review and approve revised proposals and pricing agreements. Contractors should plan for potential delays or rejections if their submissions do not meet new requirements.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Review and revise your contract early, before receiving notifications from GSA, to ensure compliance with updated requirements.
* Plan for dedicated staff and resources to manage the update process and minimize disruptions to business operations.
* Consider seeking professional assistance to navigate changes and ensure accurate implementation.

### A. Recap of key takeaways from FY26 GSA schedule updates

As the federal fiscal year (FY) approaches its midpoint, it's essential for GSA schedule holders to stay informed about the latest updates and changes. Here are key takeaways from the FY26 GSA schedule updates that contractors need to know:

**Updated Contract Pricing Requirements**

The FY26 update includes new contract pricing requirements that contractors must adhere to. Specifically, GSA is implementing a new price reasonableness review process for all contracts exceeding $10 million. This means that contractors with high-value contracts will need to provide additional pricing documentation and justification to ensure compliance.

**Expansion of Authorized Contracting Officers (ACOs)**

The FY26 update also expands the authority of Authorized Contracting Officers (ACOs) to award contracts up to $20 million without further competition. While this may seem like a boon for contractors, it's essential to note that ACOs will still be required to conduct price reasonableness reviews and ensure compliance with other contract requirements.

**Changes to Solicitation Content Requirements**

The FY26 update introduces new solicitation content requirements, including the need for contractors to provide detailed information on their small business participation and subcontracting plans. Contractors should review their proposals carefully to ensure they meet these updated requirements and are prepared to provide the necessary documentation.

**Action Items for GSA Schedule Holders**

To stay compliant with FY26 updates, contractors should:

* Review and update contract pricing documentation to reflect new requirements
* Ensure that ACOs have the necessary authority to award contracts up to $20 million without competition
* Update solicitation content to include detailed information on small business participation and subcontracting plans

By taking these steps, GSA schedule holders can ensure they are well-positioned for success in FY26 and beyond.

### B. Call to action for contractors to stay informed and adapt to changing regulations

As GSA Schedule updates for FY26 take effect, it's essential that contractors stay informed and adapt to changing regulations to maintain their competitive edge. To ensure compliance and capitalize on new opportunities, contractors must be proactive in monitoring updates and adjusting their strategies accordingly.

One key action item is to review the updated Solicitation Package (Solic-Pkg) for changes to contract terms and conditions. This package will outline any revisions to pricing, delivery schedules, or other critical requirements. Contractors should carefully examine the revised solicitation to understand how it affects their business operations and pricing structures.

Another critical step is to assess the impact of updated clauses on existing contracts. For instance, the new Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.204-26, "Evaluating Contractor Performance," requires contractors to report any material changes in their organization or ownership structure. Contractors must review their contract files and update their records accordingly.

To stay ahead of the curve, contractors should also:

* Regularly check the GSA website for updates on Schedule program policies and procedures
* Attend industry events and conferences to network with other contractors and learn about best practices
* Engage with GSA representatives through regular meetings or email correspondence to clarify any questions or concerns

By taking proactive steps to stay informed, government contractors can minimize risks and capitalize on new opportunities presented by the updated GSA Schedule for FY26.
