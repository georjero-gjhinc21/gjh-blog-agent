We'll break down the must-knows for contractors, from the technical evaluation criteria to the contract award process, so you can position yourself for success in this highly competitive landscape."

## II. Key Requirements for Winning a GSA Schedule 70 Contract

To win a GSA Schedule 70 contract, contractors must meet or exceed several key requirements outlined in the Request for Proposal (RFP). One of the most critical aspects is pricing. Contractors are required to submit three price schedules: Fixed Price, Time and Materials (T&M), and Labor Hour (LH). It's essential to understand that prices submitted in these schedules become binding contract terms.

When preparing their offers, contractors should carefully review the RFP's solicitation number, which corresponds to a specific North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. This ensures they are competing against other contractors with similar capabilities and expertise. Contractors must also provide an accurate, up-to-date list of products or services offered, including detailed descriptions, specifications, and pricing.

In addition to pricing and product/service offerings, contractors are required to demonstrate their business capabilities, including past performance, organizational structure, and quality control processes. This includes submitting relevant documents such as past contracts, certifications (e.g., ISO 9001), and compliance with industry standards.

Contractors must also ensure they have the necessary resources in place to support a GSA Schedule 70 contract, including personnel with required skills, facilities, equipment, and supplies. A thorough review of the RFP's requirements, combined with careful planning and preparation, is crucial for success in winning a GSA Schedule 70 contract.

## III. Understanding the Solicitation Package: What to Expect in an RFP

When reviewing a GSA Schedule 70 Request for Proposal (RFP), it's essential to understand what to expect and how to navigate the solicitation package. A typical RFP includes several key components that are designed to guide the contractor through the proposal submission process.

First, familiarize yourself with the overall structure of the RFP. Most will include an Executive Summary, followed by a detailed Technical Proposal (including sections on Technical Approach, Management Plan, and Past Performance), a Pricing Proposal, and any applicable exhibits or attachments. Pay close attention to the requirements outlined in each section, as they may be specific to your business or service offerings.

In the Technical Proposal, you'll typically find a comprehensive breakdown of the government's needs and expectations. This is where you'll outline your approach to meeting these requirements, highlighting relevant expertise, experience, and resources. The Management Plan should demonstrate your ability to effectively manage the contract, including resource allocation and risk mitigation strategies.

When evaluating the solicitation package, consider the following key takeaways:

* Ensure all sections are thoroughly reviewed to avoid overlooking critical requirements.
* Develop a clear understanding of the government's needs and expectations.
* Tailor your proposal to showcase relevant expertise and experience.
* Verify that all attachments and exhibits are properly submitted and referenced in the proposal.

By carefully examining each component of the RFP, contractors can increase their chances of submitting a competitive proposal. Remember to allocate sufficient time for review and preparation, as this will enable you to create a comprehensive and compelling submission.

## IV. Navigating the Evaluation Criteria: What Makes a Proposal Stand Out

When preparing to submit a proposal in response to a GSA Schedule 70 RFP, it's essential to understand the evaluation criteria that will be used to assess your company's qualifications and solution. The GSA evaluates proposals based on three main areas: Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price.

To stand out from other bidders, it's crucial to demonstrate exceptional technical capability in addressing the requirements outlined in the RFP. This involves providing detailed explanations of how your company's products or services meet the government's needs, along with any relevant certifications, licenses, or endorsements that support your claims.

When evaluating past performance, the GSA will assess your company's history of successfully delivering similar projects or services to the government. To showcase your past performance effectively, be sure to highlight specific examples of successful projects, including metrics such as customer satisfaction ratings and on-time delivery percentages.

While price is an essential factor in the evaluation process, it shouldn't be the primary focus of your proposal. Instead, concentrate on demonstrating the value that your company's products or services bring to the government, including any cost savings or efficiencies that can be achieved through your solution. For instance, if you're offering a cloud-based service, highlight how this will reduce the government's infrastructure costs and improve scalability.

When preparing your proposal, make sure to carefully review the evaluation criteria outlined in the RFP and tailor your response accordingly. This may involve developing specific case studies or examples that illustrate your company's technical capabilities and past performance. By doing so, you'll be well on your way to creating a compelling proposal that stands out from the competition and increases your chances of securing a GSA Schedule 70 contract.

## V. Tips and Strategies for Crafting a Winning Proposal

When responding to GSA Schedule 70 RFPs, it's essential to have a well-crafted proposal that showcases your company's capabilities and meets the agency's requirements. Here are some key tips and strategies to help you increase your chances of success:

**Understand the Solicitation**: Carefully review the RFP to identify the specific needs and priorities outlined by the government. Note any areas where your company can offer unique solutions or benefits.

**Develop a Clear and Concise Proposal Structure**: Organize your proposal using clear headings, bullet points, and concise paragraphs. Use standard formatting throughout to facilitate review. Consider including an executive summary or brief overview of your company's relevant experience.

**Highlight Your Company's Unique Value Proposition (UVP)**: Clearly articulate how your company can meet the agency's needs more effectively than other bidders. Highlight any certifications, awards, or specializations that set you apart.

**Use Plain Language and Avoid Technical Jargon**: Ensure your proposal is accessible to non-technical reviewers by using clear, concise language. Avoid acronyms and technical terms unless absolutely necessary.

**Quantify Your Benefits**: Use metrics and data to demonstrate the value of your proposed solution. For example, if you're offering a software solution that improves efficiency by 25%, be sure to highlight this benefit in your proposal.

**Include Relevant Certifications and Awards**: Ensure all relevant certifications (e.g., CMMI, ISO 9001) and awards are prominently displayed throughout the proposal. This demonstrates your company's commitment to quality and excellence.

By following these tips and strategies, you can increase your chances of submitting a winning proposal that showcases your company's capabilities and meets the agency's needs. Remember to carefully review the solicitation and tailor your proposal accordingly. With a well-crafted proposal, you'll be well-positioned to secure a contract award under GSA Schedule 70.

## VI. Common Mistakes to Avoid When Responding to GSA Schedule 70 RFPs

When responding to GSA Schedule 70 Requests for Proposal (RFPs), contractors often make mistakes that can lead to rejection, delays, or even loss of revenue opportunities. To avoid these pitfalls and maximize success, it's essential to be aware of common missteps and take proactive steps to address them.

One of the most critical errors is inadequate research and proposal planning. Contractors must thoroughly review the RFP requirements, ensure they have the necessary capabilities and resources, and develop a tailored response strategy before investing time and effort into writing the proposal. This includes identifying all relevant sections and requirements, understanding the evaluation criteria, and determining the best approach to demonstrate expertise and value.

Another common mistake is submitting incomplete or inaccurate proposals. Contractors must meticulously review their responses for compliance with RFP requirements, ensuring that all necessary information is included and accurate. A single omission or error can lead to rejection, so it's crucial to double-check every aspect of the proposal, including pricing, technical capabilities, and past performance.

Contractors should also be mindful of submission deadlines and follow the required formatting guidelines carefully. Late submissions or proposals that do not conform to the specified format may be rejected outright, resulting in missed opportunities.

By being aware of these common mistakes and taking proactive steps to address them, contractors can significantly improve their chances of success when responding to GSA Schedule 70 RFPs.
